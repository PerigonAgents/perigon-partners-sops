# Perigon Partners — SOPs

This repository contains the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Perigon Partners' internal automation tools.

Each SOP is a self-contained HTML file, designed to be hosted via Netlify and linked to directly.

## Current SOPs

| Tool | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Meeting Note Bot | `meeting-note-bot-sop.html` | How to use the automated Teams transcript → meeting notes pipeline |
| LinkedIn Post Generator | `linkedin-post-generator-sop.html` | How the LinkedIn content automation works for Emma |

## Adding a new SOP

1. Create a new HTML file in this repo following the existing naming convention: `[tool-name]-sop.html`
2. Use the existing SOP files as a design template to maintain consistent styling
3. Commit and push to `main` — Netlify will auto-deploy

## Deployment

This repo is connected to Netlify. Any push to `main` triggers an automatic deploy.
